# Time Tracker

This is an Work day control system, created as a personal project.  


## Technologies used

### Client
The client side has been developed using technologies such as React, TypeScript and JSX. Among the most used packages are Redux for application state management, React Router DOM v6 for navigation between pages, and Axios for HTTP requests. In addition, styles have been created using CSS, although it is intended to enhance them by using Tailwind CSS for more efficient and scalable style management.

### Server

On the server side, an API has been developed using ASP.NET Core Web API. An authentication system based on JWT tokens (JSON Web Token) has been implemented to ensure the security of communications between the client and the server. In addition, MySQL has been used as a database to store and manage the application data.
